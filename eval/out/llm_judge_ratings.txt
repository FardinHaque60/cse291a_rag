Prompt: What does the New York times say is the best wireless headphones?
Response: The New York Times has a guide for the best headphones. They review and test many headphones and earphones. The guides include wireless earbuds, over-ear headphones, and options for noise cancellation, Bluetooth codecs, and more.

Gemini Rating: 3 - Good: The response correctly identifies that The New York Times has a guide for best headphones and covers various types. However, it fails to directly answer the user's specific question about *which* wireless headphones are considered the best by the NYT, which was the core of the query.
